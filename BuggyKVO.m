In Objective-C, a rare but perplexing issue can arise from the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and the object's lifecycle, particularly when dealing with weak references.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyObject : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, weak) id<MyProtocol> observer;
@end

@implementation MyObject
- (void)someMethod {
    [self addObserver:self.observer forKeyPath:@"someProperty" options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew context:NULL];
}
```

If `self.observer` is deallocated before `[self removeObserver...]` is called, a crash might not occur immediately. However, subsequent attempts to observe changes on `someProperty` could lead to unpredictable behavior or crashes later on, potentially long after the weak reference has been invalidated. The crash is usually related to sending a message to a deallocated object. This isn't always caught during testing, because the timing of the deallocation relative to KVO operations can be subtle and difficult to reproduce consistently.
